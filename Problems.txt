0 - There are four cards on a table showing symbols D, E, 2 and 3 (one per card).
	Each card has a letter on one side and a digit on the other. Which card(s) do you need
	to turn over to determine whether every card with a D on one side has a 3 on the other? Why?
	
		We first need to check the first card with a 'D', since 'every card with a D on one side
		has a 3 on the other' implies that cards having letters other than D can also have a 3
		on the other side. We also don't have to check the second card, since D isn't a digit.
		So we should also check the third card, to make sure that there's no D there.
	
2 - Prove each of the following laws of Binary Theory using the proof format in SubSection 1.0.1
	and any laws listed in Section 11.4. Do not use the Completion Rule.
	
	(f) - (a⇒c)∧(b⇒¬c)⇒¬(a∧b)

	(h) - a⇒b ≡
	
12 - Formalize each of the following statements as a binary expression.
	Start by staying as close as possible to the English, then simplify as much as possible
	(sometimes no simplification is possible). You will have to introduce new basic binary
	expressions like (the door can be opened) for parts that cannot make use of binary operators,
	but for words like "only if" you should use binary operators. You translate meanings from words
	to binary symbols; the meaning of the words may depend on their context and even on facts not
	explicitly stated. Formalization is not a simple substitution of symbols for words.
	
16 - (tennis) An advertisement for a tennis magazine says "If I'm not playing tennis, I'm watching
	tennis. And if I'm not watching tennis, I'm reading about tennis.". Assuming the speaker cannot
	do more than one of these activities at a time,
	
	(a) Prove that the speaker is not reading about tennis.
	(b) What is the speaker doing?
